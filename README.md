[my-vimrc](https://github.com/fboudreau/my-vimrc)
========

This is the contents of my .vimrc file. I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to 
manage the plugins that I like to use and place it here to make it easy for me to share 
with the different systems that I work with (home and job).

Note, it is a dot (.) file and will be hidden when you have a look in the clone!
